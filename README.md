# HyperLedger
Shared files for Hyperledger Composer tutorial

The files included are expected to be run on a Ubuntu 16.04 installation to prepare the machine for completing the [Hyperledger Composer Tutorials ](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/tutorials/tutorials.html)

The scripts are numbered in order and need to be run as SUDO except for the second script (as stated explicitly in the script name).
